Exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic Dataset

### Objective
The objective here is to conduct Exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic Dataset in order to gather insights and evenutally predicting survior on basics of factors like Class ,Sex , Age , Gender ,Pclass etc.

### Why EDA?

An approach to summarize, visualize, and become intimately familiar with the important characteristics of a data set.
Defines and Refines the selection of feature variables that will be used for machine learning.
Helps to find hidden Insights
It provides the context needed to develop an appropriate model with minimum errors

### About Event

The RMS Titanic was a British passenger liner that sank in the North Atlantic Ocean in the early morning hours of 15 April 1912, after it collided with an iceberg during its maiden voyage from Southampton to New York City. There were an estimated 2,224 passengers and crew aboard the ship, and more than 1,500 died, making it one of the deadliest commercial peacetime maritime disasters in modern history. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.
